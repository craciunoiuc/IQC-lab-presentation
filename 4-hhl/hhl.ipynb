    "# HHL Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, also called HHL algorithm, designed by Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd, is a quantum algorithm formulated in 2009 for solving linear systems.\n",
    "The algorithm estimates the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector to a given linear system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided the linear system is sparse and has a low condition number k, and that the user is interested in the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector, instead of the values of the solution vector itself, then the algorithm has a runtime of `O(log(N)k^2)` where N is the number of unknowns in the system.\n",
    "This offers an exponential speedup over the fastest classical algorithm, which runs in `O(Nk)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first demonstration of a general-purpose version of the algorithm appeared in 2018 in the work of Zhao et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./res/hhl.png\" alt=\"Controlled U\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will demonstrate the algorithm for solving linear systems by Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL).\n",
    "\n",
    "The HHL algorithm solves a system of linear equations, specifically equations of the form `Ax = b`, where A is a Hermitian matrix, b is a known vector, and x is the unknown vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses 3 sets of qubits: a single ancilla qubit, a register (to store eigenvalues of A), and memory qubits (to store |b> and |x>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are performed in order:\n",
    " 1. Quantum phase estimation to extract eigenvalues of A\n",
    " 2. Controlled rotations of ancilla qubit\n",
    " 3. Uncomputation with inverse quantum phase estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is perfect if:\n",
    " * Each eigenvalue of the matrix is in the form `2π/t * k/N`, where `0≤k<N`, and `N=2^n`, where n is the register size. In other words, k is a value that can be represented exactly by the register.\n",
    " * `C ≤ 2π/t * 1/N`, the smallest eigenvalue that can be stored in the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is good if the register size is large enough such that for every pair of eigenvalues, the ratio can be approximated by a pair of possible register values.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to set t is `t = 2π/(sN)`"
